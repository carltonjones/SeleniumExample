SeleniumExample - Using Selenium with C#.NET
===============

This solution demonstrates automated testing web pages with Selenium and C#.NET. It can also be used as a template for new Selenium test projects.

Three tests are included that run tests on the publically available demo website Altoro Mutual available at http://demo.testfire.net/. The tests test logging onto the website and transferring an amount between two accounts.

EDIT: Forked by Carlton Jones for Ministry of Test Demonstration.
